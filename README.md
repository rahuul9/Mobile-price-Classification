Mobile Price Classification

# Introduction :-
The project topic is “Mobile Price Classification”. Our main aim is to predict the price range of mobile phones compared to features available for respective prices. Finding relationship price range and feature will help in determining prices and profit margins for new devices.  
Process:- For data preprocessing ,we selected the features we the were identified while collecting the data with targeting the price range. With training size as 75% and test size as 25% of data while random shuffle of 24 values we selected “standardscaler” for further operations.

# Following Features were listed:-
•	Battery_Power: Total Energy A Battery Can Store In Mah
•	Blue: Has Bluetooth Or Not
•	Clock_Speed: Speed At Which Microprocessor Executes Instructions
•	Dual_Sim: Has Dual Sim Support Or Not
•	Fc: Front Camera Mega Pixels
•	Four_G: Has 4g Or Not
•	Int_Memory: Internal Memory In Gigabytes
•	M_Dep: Mobile Depth In Cm
•	Mobile_Wt: Weight Of Mobile Phone
•	N_Cores: Number Of Cores Of Processor
•	Pc: Primary Camera Mega Pixels
•	Px_Height: Pixel Resolution Height
•	Px_Width: Pixel Resolution Width
•	Ram: Random Access Memory In Megabytes
•	Sc_H: Screen Height Of Mobile In Cm
•	Sc_W: Screen Width Of Mobile In Cm
•	Talk_Time: Longest Time That Battery Will Last By A Call
•	Three_G: Has 3g Or Not
•	Touch_Screen: Has Touch Screen Or Not
•	Wifi: Has Wifi Or Not
  
  # Exploratory Data Analysis
•	We found that data is free from null and duplicate values, hence we continued with model selection.
NoteBooks: :- We used “Anaconda Jupyter NoteBook” for our code and machine learning model.
